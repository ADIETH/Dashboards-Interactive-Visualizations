first of all 70 % of the code is given.
1. the first part of the code is building function to render data inti metadata panel in UI.
 the code is using d3,json to grab record about each participant from sample_metadata table
 it is like displaying related record from associated table. if it was spatial data it could have relation class 
declaring varibale to select sample number(primary key) from sample meta data table and tied back to sample in samples table
// Use `.html("") to clear any existing metadata when new sample selected by user and it would set the content from sample metadata  and overwrite the content of newly selected sample.
    
// Iterate through each key and value of each object using  `Object.entries` and `forEach`  and append them in div panel using tag for each key value

2.the second part is creating visualization by building chart using function to grab data from our path 
fetching eachsample from samples table

// declaring  varible using const to have better performance when rendering our charts
// for this project  the  three variable(otu_ids,otu_labels,sample_values) won't be changed for the life time of the research because they are holding unique value for each participant data.
  //Build Bubble chart
// Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from  samples route (/samples/<sample>) to display each sample.
providing data and layout for pie and Bubble

the last part of the code is initialization the dashboard and setting the first sample  to build the initial plot by creating funcion 
delcaring variable using d3.select to set source for the dropdown from sampple column
  // Use the first sample from the list to build the initial plots

  the final function is setting the dashboard to be intteractive when new sample is selected
